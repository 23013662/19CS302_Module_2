# EX 6 C Program to print the string "KEYBOARD" n number of times.
## AIM:
To write a C Program to print the string "KEYBOARD" n number of times.

## Algorithm
1.Input a number: Read an integer value from the user (a).
2.Initialize a counter: Set i = 1 to track iterations.
3.Loop condition check: Ensure i is less than or equal to a.
4.Print "KEYBOARD": Display the word in each iteration.
5.Increment counter: Increase i  

## Program:
